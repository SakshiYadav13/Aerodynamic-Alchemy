## Objectives
1.	Increase occupancy rate: By raising the average profit per seat and boosting occupancy, we can lessen the effects of the difficulties we are now facing.

2.	Improve pricing strategy: In order to draw in and keep consumers, we must devise a price plan that takes into consideration the shifting market dynamics and consumer preferences.

3.	Enhance customer experience: In order to stand out in a very competitive market and win over more repeat business, we must concentrate on giving our clients a smooth and convenient experience from booking to arrival.
The ultimate purpose of this assignment is to find ways to boost the occupancy rate on underperforming flights, which can ultimately result in higher airline profitability.
